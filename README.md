# ViewSafe
ViewSafe is an AI-powered screen distance awareness app for students and professionals who spend long hours on laptops. It uses real-time face tracking to detect when you’re too close to the screen and alerts you instantly. ViewSafe requires no setup or calibration and works quietly in the background to promote healthier screen habits.
