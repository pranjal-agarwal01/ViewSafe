Cool — let’s design it like a real product build. Here’s the **tech stack + project stages** (overview only). You tell me which stage to deep-dive.

## Suggested tech stack (practical for laptops)

**Core (MVP)**

* **Python** (fast prototyping)
* **OpenCV** (webcam capture + overlay UI)
* **MediaPipe Face Mesh** (face landmarks + stable measurement)
* **Numpy** (math, smoothing)

**Desktop app packaging**

* **PyInstaller** (Windows exe)
* Optional: **Auto-start** via Windows Startup / Task Scheduler

**If you want a “real product” UI**

* **Electron + Python backend** (desktop UI)
  or
* **Tauri + Rust** (lighter, more advanced)

**If you want cross-platform + browser**

* **Web app**: JavaScript + **MediaPipe Tasks / TensorFlow.js** (runs in browser using webcam)
* Optional: **Chrome extension** (overlay + notifications)

# Project Stages (end-to-end roadmap)

## Stage 0 — Product decisions (1–2 hrs)

* Define thresholds (Safe/Close/Danger)
* Decide output: overlay + sound + notification
* Decide platform: Python desktop MVP vs Browser MVP

Deliverable: spec (1-page)

---

## Stage 1 — Camera + Face Detection (MVP base)

* Open webcam stream
* Run Face Mesh
* Draw face landmarks/bounding

Deliverable: live webcam window with face tracking

---

## Stage 2 — Distance Metric (relative, calibration-free)

* Pick two stable landmarks (e.g., cheekbone or eye outer corners)
* Measure pixel distance each frame
* Compute **ratio vs baseline** (first 10–20 sec)
* Smooth using EMA

Deliverable: live “ratio” number that’s stable (no zones yet)

---

## Stage 3 — Zones + Alerts (actual usefulness)

* Convert ratio → Safe/Close/Danger zone
* Overlay text + color indicator
* Optional alerts:

  * beep
  * pop-up
  * vibration (only for mobile)

Deliverable: working “Danger zone” warnings

---

## Stage 4 — Background app experience (people actually use it)

* Run in background (tray icon)
* Auto-start on boot
* “Snooze” button (e.g., 10 min)
* Minimum CPU usage

Deliverable: lightweight always-on monitor

---

## Stage 5 — Analytics (makes it sticky + impressive)

* Track:

  * total screen time
  * danger time
  * sessions per day
* Local storage: JSON/SQLite
* Simple dashboard (weekly trend)

Deliverable: report screen + charts

---

## Stage 6 — Production packaging & distribution

* Windows installer / signed exe
* Versioning + auto-update (optional)
* Privacy mode (no image storage)

Deliverable: “install and run” build

---

## Stage 7 — V2 upgrades (optional)

Pick based on ambition:

* Multiple faces detection (library / office)
* Posture detection (neck angle)
* “Low blink rate” indicator (dry eye risk)
* Dynamic thresholds per user (personalized baseline)

---

Tell me what platform you want first:
**A) Python desktop MVP (fastest)**
**B) Browser-only (easiest distribution)**
**C) Chrome extension (best for students/professionals)**

And I’ll go deep into the chosen stage starting from Stage 1.
